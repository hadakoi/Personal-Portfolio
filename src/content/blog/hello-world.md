Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on technology, cybersecurity, and software development.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:
- **Cybersecurity**: Insights from my work and research
- **Linux & Low-Level Systems**: Deep dives into how things work
- **Projects**: Breakdowns of things I'm building
- **Learning Journey**: What I'm studying and discovering

## Why a Blog?

Writing helps me think more clearly and document my learning. Plus, if my notes help someone else, that's a bonus!

Stay tuned for more posts.
